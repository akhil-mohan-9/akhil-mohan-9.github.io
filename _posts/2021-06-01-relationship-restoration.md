God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the garden of Eden. Little did they know that the tree from which they weren’t supposed to eat was placed in the garden to demonstrate their freedom of choice; to practise freewill, to love. I sometimes imagine what if I was in Adam’s or Eve’s position. Knowing the lures, desires and struggles I face daily; I can easily conclude that I would’ve let God down as well. 

God is love. But often we forget the fact that God’s love cannot overrule His justice. God’s love is demonstrated in the presence of judgment not in the absence of it. Since God is love, He longs to restore the relationship He once had with humanity so that we can walk with Him as Adam and Even used to in the garden of Eden. God’s justice cannot let sin go unpunished. The recent Avengers movie had a punchline ‘Whatever it takes!’ which came into a meaningful fruition when Tony Stark (aka Ironman) sacrificed his life in the end for the sake of others (which was the only way!). 

God also knew before the beginning of time, that the only way to reconcile humanity to Him was to give Himself up for them. And the first promise given to us from the Bible was regarding “the offspring of woman” (Genesis 3:15) who would crush the head of that serpent which shall also strike His (woman’s offspring) heel. This promise was fulfilled when Jesus defeated death once and for all by sacrificing Himself on the cross for our sake (which was the only way!). As it is rightly said, the cross of Calvary is where God’s love and justice meet. That my friends, was the only way!

This reminds us why 2000 years ago Jesus was born in that manger in Bethlehem. That was God incarnate, the creator of the Universe, who intervened at a time in history to fulfil the law and the prophets and reconcile humanity back to Him. I hope this sacrificial love of Christ renews us daily, and the least we can do is share this amazing love wherever we are placed in life. 

When you think about it, it is true indeed, the best part of a relationship is restoring it.
