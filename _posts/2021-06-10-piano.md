Everyone perceives music in a unique way. For some, violin music pierces straight through the soul, while for others flute music does the job. For me, it always has been piano music. Listening to a melody played in piano just draws my attention and a running base line would compliment it to perfection. I always had an affinity towards music and talented musicians. In my childhood when I got into learning the theory of music, I learned to respect all those talented and perseverant musicians. As I grew older, I knew that I was a person who wanted to see immediate results, was impatient and in a way lazy. I do not take pride in that. However, that has made me listen to music and practise playing by ear rather than following the musical notations. It has its boons and banes. But I felt it gave me the freedom to express myself in every piece of music I played even though it was composed by others. It is just like an artist’s rendition of an original song, nothing more, nothing less. 

The very first digital keyboard my dad bought for me was the Yamaha PSR-150 in the early 2000s. It had an excerpt of Beethoven’s Fur Elise pre-recorded in the system. And the display showed the respective keys in motion while the song was being played. It was the first song I taught myself by simply slowing the tempo and learning along progressively. I still remember how good it felt when I could first play it fairly well. I had a talented friend in high school who could play any song by ear. He did influence me in my amateur piano journey. I kept practising digital keyboard occasionally even as I pursued guitar music for most of my high school and engineering days.

I always wanted to get a digital piano simply to feel the weighted key hammer action. A digital piano replicates the same feel on your fingers as if you were playing an acoustic piano. The lockdown in 2020 told me that it was time to get one to keep myself engaged in something rather than nothing. And I finally got my first digital piano, the Yamaha P-45B. Ah! It was an amazing feeling and I wish I could express it through some music. I made a list of songs I wanted to learn properly using music notations. Well, as you may have guessed that didn’t happen. What did happen was I tried learning my recent favourite song by ear and posted it on Instagram every other time. This kept me going and helped me grow at the same time. 

It is high time I reveal that my favourite scale is E-minor (Em). It is my go-to scale when it comes to any song with a touch of emotion border lining sorrow or despair. It is also a scale where I love to play many of my favourite Christian songs. Something about that scale touches my soul and allows me to freely express it through my fingers. Not everyone gets the sense to enjoy and perceive piano music. Well, I know that I didn’t choose it which is why I’m thankful that it’s another one of God’s choicest blessing to me.
