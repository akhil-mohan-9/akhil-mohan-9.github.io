To keep love is to invest our time with the people we need to be with not the ones we want. Read it again and I hope you find the difference between a need and a want. Trust me it will stop you from chasing the people you thought you need when they were just a want.

Our lives are filled with wants. It may be different to different folks depending on their character and deepest desires. I may want a car now even though it is not a necessity, and the public transport is decent and offers me a good transit. I think the key question one must ask when it comes to love, or any other want is ‘can I live without it?’. If the answer is yes, then most often than not it is just a want, something you can live without. If the answer is no, then most often than not it is a need, something you can’t live without. A simple test question would be ‘can I live without oxygen?’, the answer is no, and that is what I call a need. 

I pray that when you pursue love, you ask this simple question to begin with. Who knows you may find that it was just a want after all, and you are better off without it?
